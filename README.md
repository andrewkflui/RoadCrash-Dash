### Requirments
Tested with these versions but older versions may work.
- Python 3.7 or above
- Pandas 1.1.5
- Plotly 5.13.0
- Dash 2.8.1
- Dash Bootstrap Component 1.3.1

### Key Files
- `roadcrash_qld.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for executing the standalone Plotly Express Interactive Map (Without Dash)
- `app.py`: The dashboard web application (using default OSM tiles)
- `app_mapbox.py`: The dashboard web application (using Mapbox tiles)
- `Dockerfile`: The Docker container configuration file for cloud deployment of the dashboard
- `mapbox_access_token.txt`: The access token obtained from Mapbox (for the version that uses Mapbox tiles)

### The Road Crashes Data File
The application requires the Road Crashes CSV file (`crash_data_queensland_1_crash_locations.csv`), which can be downloaded from the [Open Data Portal](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/crash-data-from-queensland-roads/resource/e88943c0-5968-4972-a15f-38e120d72ec0) of the Queensland Government, Australia.

The file should be placed under the folder `data` in the root folder.

### Mapbox Access Token
A mapbox access token is required for running `app_mapbox.py`, which uses Mapbox tiles as specified with the statement.
```
fig.update_layout(mapbox_style="dark", mapbox_accesstoken=mapbox_access_token)
```
You may change the style from the dark theme to other available [themes](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/).  

Please visit https://www.mapbox.com/ to create an account, obtain an access token, and store the token in the file `mapbox_access_token.txt`.
